The project Task was to Analyze Resturant data from the company Zomato to see what sort of factors could be linked to average resturant revenue, such as location and cuisine type. Analysis was done comparing average revenue by average rating of resturants, location of the resturants, and what cuisine the resturant specalized in. The project found that north eastern and Burmese cuisine types, resturants in the north and southern parts of India, and higher rated resturants, on average, had higher revenue amounts. Further data analysis could be done to see why certian resturants had high revenue amounts despite the low ratings, and the number of locations of the highest profiting resturants.
