The project task was to analyze user data and make funnels to show conversion rates amongst cohorts from viewing items all the way to purchasing them for an online e-commerce website. The conversion rates were calculated both by determining how many of the original users transfered from the first step all the way to the last step, and how many unique users transferred from one step to the next. Most cohorts one purchase items in month 1, then leave, and 10 percent of those who view product pages actually purchase them.
