The project task was to prepare a analysis of the most popular and profitable neighborhoods to buy rental Airbnb properties in New York. Analysis were conducted to see what sort of occupancy rates each rental had and occupancy rate by day, average cost of a rental by night, and the amount of reviews as a way to determine the most popular neighborhoods for rental properties. It was found that, in one of the most popular rental neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen, if one were to narrow it down to the most popular size of rental, 1 or 2 bedrooms, the average yearly profit would be $99,000.
