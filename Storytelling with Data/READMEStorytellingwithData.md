The project task was to analize a store with declining revenue to see if there were connections between Return rate and various other factors. Analysis was done with different visualizations to see if there were connections between Return rate and subcategories and categories, customers and geographic location. It was found that western states had a much higher return rate than average, and some customers had 90% return rates or higher. It was also shown that some categories have higher return rates, but still had high sales rates. Further investigation would be needed to see why certian areas had higher return rates, and why certian customers returned all or almost all of their products.
